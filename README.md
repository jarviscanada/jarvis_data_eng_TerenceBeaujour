# Terence Beaujour . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from Paris Diderot school with a Bachelor in Science of Engineering and from Paris-Sorbonne University/DataScientest with the equivalent of a Master Degree in Data Science. I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience using Python and data manipulation/analysis and working with REST APIs (especially for crypto-currencies). I have also 2 years of experience building machine learning software and 1 year of experience with NodeJS and databases (SQL/NoSQL) and back-end development in general. I am passionate about data science and data engineering and my goal is to join a great team of engineers so I can bring my skills and competences and I can learn as much as I can from them.

## Skills

**Proficient:** Python, Machine Learning, Scikit Learn, XGBoost, Data analysis, Pandas, Numpy, Agile/Scrum, Jira, Version control, Git, Docker, REST API

**Competent:** NodeJS, RDBMS/SQL, Java, Deep Learning, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MQL5, Linux/Bash, NoSQL, Data Structures, Algorithms

**Familiar:** PySpark, C++, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Kubernetes, AWS

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TerenceBeaujour](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TerenceBeaujour)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TerenceBeaujour/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a software that retrieves and stores hardware information and resources usage for a Linux cluster of 10 nodes running on CentOS 7. Bash scripts were generated to store the data in a PostgreSQL database that was run by a docker container.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_TerenceBeaujour/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Implemented a back-end Twitter application that allows users to search, to post and delete Tweets via the official Twitter REST API. Used the minus V design pattern to implement the software and wrote robust tests for it.
  - JDBC App: The JDBC application helped me to learn how to interact with the library and to work efficiently with it, it allows to work with CRUD operation. I used a PSQL container to set the database and Maven to generate the project structure.
  - Grep App: Implemented a Java software that mimics Linux command grep, which allows users to search matching patterns from files. Dockerized the app using Docker.


## Highlighted Projects
**Machine Learning** [[GitHub](https://github.com/terencebeauj/mle_project)]: Implemented a complete machine/deep learning unit for the Noum√©a hospital in New-Caledonia. This tool allows the hospital to answer different problems, Prediction of patient admission (classification), prediction of length of stay in the emergency department (regression) and prediction of patient flow the next day (Recurrent Neural Network). We hava used Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, xgBoost,TensorFlow, SQL, Docker, Kubernetes and FastAPI to build the project.

**Algorithmic Trading**: Realization of an arbitrage algorithm for crypto currencies. Real time data retrieval with websockets on the Binance exchange, scanning of 1000 different triangles in real time, placing limit orders using multi-threading. We have used Python, PyCharm, git, github, google cloud, ccxtpro, multi-threading and websockets to build the project.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Engineer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Worked on a complete project using Linux, SQL and docker, to help Jarvis team to monitor their cluster. Used Agile method to collaborate with other team members and to manage the project.

**Software Developer, Vezgo (2021-2022)**: Optimized and implemented different connectors to connect and retrieve data from different exchanges and blockchain. Used NodeJS to implement the software, connected to MongoDB database to store and manage the data. Used git and github to manage the software and Agile method to manage the project.


## Education
**Paris-Sorbonne university (2021)**, Equivalent Master in France, Data Sciences

**Paris Diderot school (2017-2018)**, Bsc Sciences of Engineering, Electrical Engineering
